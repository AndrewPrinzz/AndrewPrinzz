## 🚀 My Journey in Code

I'm Andrew, a self-taught Software Engineer. I discovered my passion for programming at my **University of Science and Technology**, where I realized that I wanted my life to be centered around Software Engineering

I decided to learn coding in parallel of my univercity programm, facing challenges along the way. Through persistence, self-discipline, and staying committed, I achieved my goal of becoming a Software Engineer.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer & freelancer. I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a software engineer, and I'm constantly amazed by how powerful software is in helping us achieve great things.
